# Energy_appliance_prediction

## Description
Algorithm to predict the energy consumption using various supervised ML algorithms (Random Forest, SVM, NN). It is a typical time-series regression problem.

## Personal development goals:
- Practising vanilla ML regression technique using [sklearn](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn).
- Practising grid search hyperparameter tuning
- Practising implementing various NNs using [Keras](https://github.com/fchollet/keras).

## Status of development:
- Data pre-processing implemented
- Basic vanilla ML implemented (Random Forest and SVR)
- Plotting results to be improved
- NNs techniques to be implemented
- All algorithms needs fine tuning to be implemented

## Requirements
The main librairies required are: `numpy`, `sklearn`, `keras`, `datetime` and `pandas`. They can be installed using `pip install` or `conda install`.

## Data
- Data were obtained from: [https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Appliances+energy+prediction](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Appliances+energy+prediction)
